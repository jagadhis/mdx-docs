# New updates to the doc editor

- Now you can manage all the docs in here directly based on your github
- you can create draft docs as PR and update the draft and save the drafts
- You can see the version history of what has been changed in the docs through github commits
- you can hit publish to merge the draft PR to main to get it deployed to dev/prod
