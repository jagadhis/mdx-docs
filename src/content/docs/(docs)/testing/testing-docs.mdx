## MDX based docs system

Previously, i had to write docs in different apps like notion or medium or somewhere else, to keep doing things from one place i made this MDX based docs system where i can write everything directly in the IDE but this can work for dev people but for non-dev people this can be bit difficult and for them i am actually building another app which is a MDX based editor
where they can write, preview, deploy and manage all the docs from that editor itself
